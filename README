=================================================

Minimum System Requirements: 
	- Java 7 or above

The configurations.properties allows you to externally configure the applications seating arrangement and max seating limits.  
Any changes made will not be used until the application is restarted.

From Command Line, Use:

	java -jar Seating.jar [FILENAME]
	
The [FILENAME] is not required and if it is not supplied, the user will be prompted for input.  The input is expected to have
a ' ' (space) delimited list of seats as the first line followed by lines that have only a number that represents the amount
of seats that are being requested.  This will continue until EOF character is met.  Output will be returned immediately. 

If a file is provided in the [FILENAME] argument, the file will be read in as input.  The format is expected to be the same.
For example java -jar Seating.jar SampleInput.txt  (assuming SampleInput.txt is in the same location as Seating.jar)

Expected Input Format: 
	R1C4 R1C6 R2C3 R2C7 R3C9 R3C10
	3
	3
	3
	1
	10
	
The output for the above should be: 
	R1C7 - R1C9
	R2C4 - R2C6
	R3C5 - R3C7
	R1C5
	Not Available
	17
	
The Not Available is printed because there is no where a group of 10 could be placed in this seating arrangment

17 is the total number of remaining seats available in this seating arrangment
